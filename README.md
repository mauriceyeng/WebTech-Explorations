# WebTech-Explorations

Welcome to my journey through the landscape of web technologies! This repository is a living document of my learning and experimentation with a range of topics from web servers to GUI development. As I delve into each area, I document my progress, challenges, and insights, making this repository a personal tech diary of sorts.

## Topics Covered

- **Web Servers & Application Servers**: Understanding the backbone of the web, creating and configuring servers.
- **Building REST APIs with Flask**: Crafting efficient and scalable APIs using Flask, a Python micro web framework.
- **API Security**: Implementing secure practices such as environment variables, API keys, and advanced authentication methods.
- **Templating with Jinja**: Creating dynamic web pages using Jinja templating.
- **GUI Development with Tkinter**: Designing graphical user interfaces with Python's Tkinter library.
- **Gradio WebUIs**: Building and hosting temporary/on-demand Web UIs using Gradio.

## Learning Objectives

- To gain a comprehensive understanding of web and application servers.
- To develop proficiency in creating and securing REST APIs.
- To explore and implement various web templating techniques.
- To learn GUI development for desktop applications.
- To experiment with rapid web UI prototyping and hosting.

## Project Structure

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific topic. Inside, you'll find subdirectories for individual projects, code snippets, and notes. The structure is organized as follows:

- `/Web_Servers`
- `/Flask_REST_APIs`
- `/API_Security`
- `/Jinja_Templating`
- `/Tkinter_GUI`
- `/Gradio_WebUIs`

## Contributing
